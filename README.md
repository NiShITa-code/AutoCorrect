The primary objective is to develop a terminal-based application that suggests correct spellings for
input words. It involves the use of trie for efficient word storage and retrieval, and the Damerau-
Levenshtein distance algorithm for calculating the closest spelling suggestions. The application will
also allow users to manage the underlying dictionary.
